# 42-Lisbon-Common-Core-ft_printf
This project is a reimplementation of the standard C printf function. It handles various format specifiers such as %c, %s, %p, %d, %i, %u, %x, %X, and %%, using variadic functions and low-level system calls. The goal is to deepen understanding of formatted output, memory handling, and parsing in C. Developed as part of the 42 Common Core curriculum.
